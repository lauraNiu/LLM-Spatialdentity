# Spatial Identity Score Prompt

```
You are a data analyst skilled in sentiment analysis and text data mining. Please conduct a spatial satisfaction analysis for social media posts. First, please review the work rules I provide.

 

## Work Process:

### Concept 

Spatial identity includes three dimensions: spatial satisfaction, spatial imagery, and spatial sense of belonging. Please always base your judgment on this definition when reasoning.

 

Spatial Satisfaction: This refers to an individual's sense of satisfaction with a space, primarily reflected in the evaluation of environmental capacity and the quantity and quality of facilities... It is the cognition generated by comfort and convenience.

 

Spatial Imagery: This refers to an individual's overall impression of a space, which gradually enriches and improves in the cognitive process. It includes three dimensions: distinguishability, uniqueness and representativeness, and imaginability... It allows people to rebuild a relatively complete image of the place in their mind.

 

Spatial Sense of Belonging: This measures the emotional intensity between an individual and a space. It includes the space's recommendability, attachment, developmental support, commitment, and devotion. Recommendability:... Willingness to sacrifice and contribute for the place.

 ### Process

The following is the process for evaluating spatial satisfaction:

 

First, determine whether each post contains the spatial satisfaction content defined above. If there is no specific description or clear expression, mark it as 0. If the post contains spatial satisfaction content, please give a score for spatial satisfaction. The score range is from -3 to 3 (integer).

 

-3 represents "Strongly disagree"

 

-2 represents "Disagree"

 

-1 represents "Slightly disagree"

 

1 represents "Slightly agree"

 

2 represents "Agree"

 

3 represents "Strongly agree"

 

The integers from -3 to -1 involve negative emotions, and the integers from 1 to 3 involve positive emotions.

 ### Example

Please refer to the example I provide:

“For first-time visitors to Shenzhen, the Futian District shopping malls are the most suitable, as they are all connected by underground passages, and it is quite convenient to start from Luohu Port and Futian Port. I strongly recommend you come next time.”

Understand my scoring concept and output format (output in markdown table format).
